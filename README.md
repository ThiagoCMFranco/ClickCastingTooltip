# ClickCastingTooltip

This is a World of Warcraft addon.  

Add a Healbot like tooltip panel for spells added to the Click Casting Binding feature.  

Game Addon Categories: Tooltip, Action Bars, Buffs & Debuffs, Miscellaneous, Unit Frames.  

Managing your keybinds just got a lot more intuitive. We’ve introduced a Healbot-style tooltip system for the Click Casting Binding feature, giving you instant clarity on which spells are mapped to your mouse buttons and modifiers.

**Total Field Control**  
This isn't just for healers. The tooltips are active across Party, Raid, Target, Focus and Boss frames. It effectively tracks your bindings for:
- Allies & NPCs: Keep your team alive and interact with friendly units with precision.
- Enemy Targets: React faster by using click-bindings for interrupts and offensive spells directly on enemy frames.

Currently Supported Languages:   
Full Support:
- Brazilian Portuguese (ptBR) - Developer Native Language  
- English (enUS) - 100% translated  
 

## Main Features
Add a healbot like tooltip for spells added to the Click Casting Binding feature.  
Functional in party, raid, target and focus frames, for players and NPCs and even enemy targets for some spells and interrupts.  
Drag and drop feature to add spells to the shortcut screen.

**Important:** This add-on does not perform automatic spellcasting, combat shortcut configuration (key and shortcut binding), or combat action monitoring (cooldown). It complies with World of Warcraft add-on guidelines from version 12.0.0 (Midnight) onwards; it only displays a visual reference to what has been defined on the 'Click-to-Cast Bindings' screen and entered separately, but correspondingly, in the add-on settings.

3. Delete te files named ClickCastingTooltip.lua and ClickCastingTooltip.lua.bak.  
4. Open tha game.
